description: Analyze the current directory structure and update memory with project knowledge
---

## Context

Please analyze the current directory structure to understand the project better and
update your memory with key insights.

## Task

1. **Explore the project structure**:
   - Use Glob to find key configuration files (*\*.nix*, *\*.md*, *package.json*,
     *Cargo.toml*, etc.)
   - Use Read to examine important files like README.md, flake.nix, or main configuration files
   - Use Grep to search for patterns that reveal the project's purpose and architecture

2. **Identify key aspects**:
   - Project type and technology stack
   - Main configuration files and their purposes
   - Directory structure and organization
   - Key dependencies or frameworks used
   - Development workflow and build processes

3. **Provide a comprehensive analysis**:
   - Summarize the project's purpose and architecture
   - List key files and directories with their functions
   - Identify development commands and workflows
   - Note any special configurations or patterns
   - Highlight important conventions or standards used

This analysis will help me better understand the project context and provide more relevant assistance.
